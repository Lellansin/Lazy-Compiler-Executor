Lazy-Compiler-Executor
======================

Lazy for gcc options and makefile writtings.

when I use gcc to compile a .c file, it will generate a a.out file by default. And we ofen should set it a output name.
After many times writting the output name, I decided to write the program lce for pass this step. So and the same reason for writting makefile.

program is simple, and it just for more convenience while we coding.
